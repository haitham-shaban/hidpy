# Comparison of Optical Flow modules between MATLAB and python

## Simulation setup
Simulations are adapted from Shaban, Barth, Bystricky (2018), NAR. Execute the file "simulate.m" in MATLAB to start simulating. Optical Flow is computed in MATLAB.

## Compute Optical Flow in python
Execute the python script "hidpy_benchmarking.py" to run the Optical Flow computation in MATLAB. The Farnebeck parameters are read in from the excel file "trials.xlsx".

## plot angular and endpoint errors
Execute the MATLAB file "compareAEEE_python_matlab.m"
